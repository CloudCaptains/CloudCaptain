## Description

કેમ છો ગુજરાતી ? 👋

We are currently working on localizing the 𝐊𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐬 website and looking for enthusiastic contributors who are fluent in 𝐆𝐮𝐣𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢. If you are interested in contributing to K8s project and have a good understanding of the 𝐆𝐮𝐣𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢 language, then please check out the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/38740).

# Who can contribute ?

- **Anyone**

Regardless of **Tech**, **Non-tech** background, complete your Official contribution to **CNFC project** and showcase your expertise and skills.

# What are we trying to do?

We will be translating/localize [K8s official website](https://kubernetes.io/). 

For example, The Kubernetes main page is in [English](https://kubernetes.io/),
This is how the main page for [Korean](https://kubernetes.io/ko/) looks like

We are going to translate pages in Gujarati, the Official [Gujarati issue link]((https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/38740))

## How to Contribute ?

Fork repo from here:  https://github.com/kubernetes/website

Go to this tracking issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/38740

Check the Status & Assigned column, you choose any file which is not assigned to anyone.

But before working on the issue, make sure to let us know in the comment section if any assistance is required. 

## Translate file

Once you selected the file to edit, What should you do? 

[If you didn't get the below instructions Refer to doc for screenshots](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lprlRKJitCGejLXd8HIoE2nar8pQfHMY9B3HZbL70To/edit)

**Here is the most exciting part**

- [Go to this page](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/main) You will always need this page if you want to contribute to any file.

- For example, you are contributing to `content/en/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos.md`

- So, this link means that there is a folder named **content** under repo, there has to be a folder named **en**, and so on and so forth….

- [Now from this page] https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/main

- Go to the **content** folder, go to **en** folder, then just go to **docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos.md**. This is the desired page we looked for to translate.

- While Our desired file is **content/gu/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos.md**

- Difference of **gu** & **en** folder only.

- Now **Fork** the official repo & go to your **forked repository**, it might look like this.

- Create a new **branch** with any name preference and follow the same process go to the **Content** folder.

- For example, you can create a branch named **branch-gu**

- Create the necessary folder structure, **gu**, **/tasks/tools**

You can **copy** the file from **en** folder and **paste** it to **gu** and start editing file **/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos.md**, **Translate** it to **Gujarati**.
